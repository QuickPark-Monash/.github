Hello everyone! This page is meant to explain about the various GitHub Repository this organization has. There are **3 repos in total**, but for the round 2 submission, **you'll only be paying attention to one of them**. üôã‚Äç Below explains the various uses of each repo in detail. 

<h2>quickpark-monash-mobile ‚≠ê</h2>
<b>This is the repo that you should visit</b>, and it contains all of the files for a mobile-website build using Angular. This repository contains an extensive ReadMe page that would guide you through our web application. Enjoy! 

<h2>quickpark-django</h2>

It is empty for now, but if we were to further develop our application, **(like in round 3)**, we will generate our backend services using django. Our MVP will not be featuring any concrete backend implementation, but will be throughly explained in the presentation.
