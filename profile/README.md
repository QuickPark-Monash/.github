Hello everyone! This page is meant to explain about the various GitHub Repository this organization has. There are **3 repos in total**, but for the round 2 submission, **you'll only be paying attention to one of them**. üôã‚Äç Below explains the various uses of each repo in detail. 

<h2>quickpark-monash-mobile ‚≠ê</h2>
<b>This is the repo that you should visit</b>, and it contains all of the files for a mobile-website build using Angular. This repository contains an extensive ReadMe page that would guide you through our web application. Enjoy! 

<h2>quickpark-angular-web</h2>

Before the mentor session, we wanted to develop the whole website on Desktop, but after the mentor session, we realized that this might not be the best way to showcase what our app can do. Our app is reliant on mobile view as most of its users will be on mobile instead. So we have decided to drop this repo for now, and focus on developing a mobile-centric interface for best UX. 

<h2>quickpark-django</h2>

It is empty for now, but if we were to further develop our application, **(like in round 3)**, we will generate our backend services using django. Our MVP will not be featuring any backend implementation.
